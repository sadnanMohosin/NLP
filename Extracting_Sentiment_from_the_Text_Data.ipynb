    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (or NLP) is ubiquitous, and has multiple applications across sectors. One of the most common applications is to analyse the sentiment or polarity of textual data - in the form of customer reviews, social media feeds, employee feedback, surveys, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentiment analysis is basically the process of determining the attitude or emotion of the text, i.e., whether it is positive, negative or neutral. In this guide, you will learn about how to extract sentiment from the text using the TextBlob library from Python. We will start by importing the libraries to be used in this guide."
